# Data-Structures-using-C-
1) If u are looking Section wise and you think some files are missing then consider them as "ONLY-THEORY" Sections.
2) If u find any bug or wrong implementation then kindly contribute to the code and fork.
3) Apologies for not adding comments. i am still getting hang of it.
4) If u unable to understand a syntax , kindly look it up on the web. But I prefer Stack-Overflow.
At Last, I hope the programs might help you to understand the working of data structures.
